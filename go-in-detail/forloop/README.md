# for loop

for loops are used to execute a block of code repetetively until the condition is true.

break keyword lets us exit loop immediately.

Number of iterations are known.

Types :
a) for with a condition 

b) for with for clause : standard for loop

                         Has 3 parts --> initialization ,condition and post statement ,seperated by semi colon ';'

c) for with range clause : iterates over elements of array ,slice,string,map,channel etc.
                           There are two iteration variables. (except for channels)

                           for array ,slice,string --> index and rune value of unicode.

                           for maps --> key and value.
                            
                           You can omit any iteration varible by replacing variable with '_'
