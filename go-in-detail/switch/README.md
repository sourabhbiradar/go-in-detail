# switch

used to execute one of many code blocks for execution.

Options are called 'cases'.

Each 'case' is associated with independent code block.

'default' case is executed when no cases are matched.

You can have multiple conditions/values in single 'case'.

'fallthrough' lets us execute THE next case AFTER a case is matched.
