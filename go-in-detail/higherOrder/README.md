# first-class citizens

In Go, functions are first-class citizens meaning they can be treated like any other value: assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as values from functions.

# higher-order func

Function that either takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function is called higher-order func.

func(type)type is called function signature..
