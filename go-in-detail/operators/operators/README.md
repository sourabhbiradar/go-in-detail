# operators

Operators combain operands into expressions.

eg : a + b 
     here , '+' is operator 
            'a' and 'b' are operands
            'a + b' as a whole is expression

Different kind of Operators :

a) arithmatic operators :  
         + , - , * , / , %

b) comparsion operators :
        ==  (equal to)
        !=  (not equal to)
        >   (greater than)
        <   (lesser than)
        <=  (lesser than or equal to)
        >=  (greater than or equal to)

c) logical operators : used to check conditions
        &&  (AND)  all conditions true --> true
        ||  (OR)   any one condition true --> true
        !   (NOT)

d) assignment operator :
        =   (assignment)
        +=  (addition assignment)
        -=
        *=
        /=
        %=
        ++  (increment operator)
        --  (decrement operator)

e) related to pointers :
       &  (address operator)
       *  (dereference operator)

Note : & , * , BITWISE operators in another code
