# maps

Maps are built-in data structures used to store key-value pairs.

Keys are unique and are used to access amd manipulate values assosiated with them in maps.

Keys are of premitive data type but values can be of any data type even map data type (nested map).

Hash maps are used to implement maps.

Hashing : key --> numerical value (hash code) using hash function.
This is done by Go.

This makes maps faster to work with.

len() is used to get number of key-value pairs.

delete() is used to delete key-value pairs.

_,ok :=name[key] used to check if key exists.
