# pointers

Pointer is variable that holds memory address of another variable.

Irrespectively of data type , pointers have same size.

'*' prefix to variable type , tells that it stores a pointer.

'*' is also used to retrieve the value stored at the address pointed to by a pointer , known as dereferencing.

'&' is used to access memory address of variable.

Pointers helps us to directly work with variable values rather than copying whole variable everytime we work with them.
