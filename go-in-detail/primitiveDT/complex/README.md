# complex 

complex data type holds real and imaginary numbers

eg:  2+3i 
    
types :

a) complex64 : uses float32 for real number and another float32 for      imaginary number

b) complex128 : uses float64 for real number and another float64 for imagianry part

complex(r , i) function can be used to create complex number in Go

real() and imag() used to get real and imaginary part respectively.
