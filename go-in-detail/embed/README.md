# embedding & promotion

Go doesn't have concept of inheritence, but provides embedding(composition) & promotion to achieve similar goals like inheritence.

Embedding : struct embedded in another struct.
Multiple structs can be embedded in another.

Promotion : Methods and fields of inner struct become part of outer struct. 
And can be accessed using outer struct's instance.
